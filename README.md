# enigma-chat-io

Welcome to engimachat.io! This full stack application is my take on a traditional chat app. There's one chat room for all users and any messages sent to the chat are visible to everyone, but each user is presented with three rotors and each message can only be deciphered when the reader has matched their rotor settings to those used by the author.
